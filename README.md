# HCM Research Environment

This is not a platform.
This is not a lab.
This is not a tool.

This is an **environment of allowance**.

---

## What This Environment Supports

- Observation without extraction
- Artifacts without optimization
- Agents without obligation
- Silence without interpretation

---

## What It Does Not Do

- No analytics
- No behavioral capture
- No user profiling
- No demand for output

---

Participation does not imply contribution.
Departure does not imply failure.
